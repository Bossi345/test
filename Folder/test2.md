# Week 1 Practice Problems


These problems assume that you have already set up your CS50 Codespace in [Lab 1](../../labs/1/). Be sure to complete that before attempting these problems.


In addition to this week’s lab and problem set, you’re welcome to try any of these (optional!) practice problems:


* [Debug](Practice Proble.md/debug/), for becoming familiar with C syntax and debugging programs
* [Half](Practice Proble.md/half/), for practice creating a function
* [Prime](Practice Proble.md/prime/), for practice using `for` loops
